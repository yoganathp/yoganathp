### Hello 👋

I'm [Yoganath P](https://yoganath.me), a 2023 graduate with a B. Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 🎓 My passion lies in exploring the vast applications of embedded systems in the real world.

Throughout my academic journey, I've delved into numerous projects, acquiring valuable hands-on experience with microcontrollers. 🛠️ These experiences have fueled my curiosity and deepened my understanding of the field.

During my spare time, you'll find me immersed in studying and sharing my insights about embedded systems on my blog. 📘
